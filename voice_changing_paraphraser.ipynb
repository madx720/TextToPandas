We have addressed the discussion of privacy in this study and proposed UDE-ID, which maintains the textual privacy of users. In addition, we have proposed an efficient linking algorithm and exchange mechanism that improves the scalability of our approach. This scalability is critical for our approach, as the number of TF-IDF vectors expands significantly with the rise of data size.In the future, we will apply the latest results in the field of semi-supervised learning to learn attributes for texts automatically. Our future work also includes the classification of the retrieved texts into different categories and summary of the retrieved texts for knowledge discovery and visualization.## 7 Appendix### 7.1 Detailed Methodology:##### Semantic Embedding#### 7.1.1 PreprocessingAll texts obtained from ROSEL were preprocessed.

It takes about 2 hours of training time on a 1990s era computer. We used a convolutional neural network architecture. Each convolutional layer has about 32, 64, and 128 filters. We implemented three architectures. In the Conv model we removed the layer output before the softMax layer. In the Conv5 model we removed the 5th convolutional layer. In the Conv5NonConv model we removed the 5th convolutional layer and the output before the softMax layer. See Figure 1 for a diagram and a comparison chart of the architectures.Figure 1.Comparison chart of the architecturesThe dataset is split into three parts. The first part contains a set of validation instances. The second part contains a set of training data instances. This part is divided into separate training and validation sets. The third part is a set of test instances. Each model is trained on the two parts for training. They are tested on the validation set.\n",

This solver is a branch-and-bound algorithm, which repeatedly applies different branching rules on one of the subproblems and merges them in order to reduce the search space. For converting a set of data using a frequency distribution, the solver uses dynamic programming, which is an effective method for determining solutions to complex combinatorial optimization problems. Here, each subproblem is treated as an instance, and the solution is a combined set of the results.The optimization variables are defined as follows:-   Maximum cardinalities of target categories: Total number of frequencies of categories is 20 and each category has a maximum cardinality of 2.-   Maximum cardinalities of source categories: Total number of frequencies of categories is 15 and each category has a maximum cardinality of 2.-   Maximum cardinalities of child categories: Total number of frequencies of categories is 7 and each category has a maximum cardinality of 2.-   Maximum\n",

The Neural Network automatically learned rules to convert sentences from Active-to-Passive or Passive-to-Active. We manually annotated around 5000 sentences as data for learning. We trained the Neural Network on 5000 sentences and tested it on 1000 sentences. The Neural Network attained an overall accuracy of 83.4% with around 94% accuracy on individual classes.## 8 Related work## 8.1 Active-to-Passive There are some studies that focus on converting Active-to-Passive sentences.## 8.1.1 Active-to-Passive Datasets One of the standard datasets for Active-to-Passive conversion is [@BD14].

One solution will be to model each sentence as a query and then feed the queries to a datasource.A query language such as SQL can be used to specify each sentence.A datasource could be a database that stores the meta data of each document. A database could be an excel sheet that has the meta data in a tabular format. So the query can be passed to the excel sheet and the respective results will be retrieved.A more formal solution will be to use natural language processing.A program that can parse the sentences will be able to get the meaning. So, it will be able to construct a query that will return the required output.A program could be written that will go through each sentence and try to convert it into a SQL query. The SQL query can be constructed such that it doesn't require any \"joins\" and \"filter\" operations. Currently we don't have a very high level language that allows us to use natural language to construct SQL queries.eg. Select * from documents where field1 = field2\n",
